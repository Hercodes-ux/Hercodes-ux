# Hi, I’m Harshini (Hercodes-ux) 👋 

**MS in Computer Science Student @ CSU | Aspiring Analytics Engineer & Data Scientist | Ex-Accenture**

I am a Graduate Student at Cleveland State University with a professional background in enterprise SQL environments at **Accenture**. Currently, I am transitioning my focus toward **Data Analytics and Data Science**, with a specific interest in building scalable, autonomous data pipelines that turn raw SQL into real-time business intelligence.

### 📚 What I’m Learning & Building
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Deep-diving into relational databases (like the Chinook music store) to uncover trends in sales and customer behavior.
- **Data Automation:** Building tools that allow users to query databases using natural language (Agentic BI).
- **Visualization:** Creating interactive dashboards and visual stories to make data accessible to decision-makers.

### 💻 Technical Toolkit (In Progress)
- **Data Engineering:** SQL (Advanced Joins, Window Functions, CTEs), SQLite.
- **AI Tools:** Exploring LangChain and LLM integration (Groq/Llama 3.3) for data tasks.
- **Platforms:** Streamlit for data web-apps, GitHub/Git for version control.

### 🎨 The "havwish" Side
Outside of the terminal, I am a passionate artist under the brand **havwish**. I focus on character sketching, face cards, and developing short-story comics. I believe that both data and art are about finding the meaning behind the details.

### 📈 2026 Career Goals
I am working toward becoming an **Analytics Engineer** or **Associate Data Scientist** by Summer 2026. I am eager to join a data-driven team where I can apply my enterprise experience and my Master's research to solve real-world problems.
